Personal Project

Hello! My online name is そら AKA Sora. This is my personal project that I'll be working on, Personal Discord Bot

This discord bot is for my personal use. The goal is when creating a time event, it will use Hammertime (https://hammertime.cyou/en-GB) and create a timestamp for me, as well as displaying what time it will be in various parts of the world Goal: Display time for GMT-8, GMT-7, GMT-6, GMT-5, GMT-0, GMT+1, GMT+2, GMT+7, GMT+8, GMT+9. The ideal is to cover: all of US, most of EU, and most of Asia (PH, JP & CN)
